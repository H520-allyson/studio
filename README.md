# Print Genie | AI-Enhanced Printing Shop

Welcome to your new AI-powered printing shop! This project is set up to automatically update your website whenever you "save" your work to GitHub.

## 🛠 Prerequisites (Do this first!)

If you are working on your own computer and saw a "git is not recognized" error, you need to install these two tools:

1.  **Git**: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (Allows you to "Push" code).
2.  **Node.js**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/) (Allows you to "Build" the app).

*Note: After installing, you MUST restart your PowerShell or Terminal window.*

## 🚀 How to Publish Your Website (The "Push" Guide)

Think of GitHub as your master storage in the cloud. "Pushing" is the act of sending your local changes to that cloud storage.

### Step 1: Prepare your changes
Open your terminal inside your project folder and run:
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 2: Label your save
Give your "save" a name so you know what you changed:
```bash
git commit -m "I updated the homepage"
```

### Step 3: Push to Main (The Publish Button)
This sends your work to the `main` (primary) version of your site on GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## 🆘 Common Errors
**"git : The term 'git' is not recognized"**

**"Permission denied"**
Make sure you are logged into GitHub in your browser or use the GitHub Desktop app to help with permissions.
